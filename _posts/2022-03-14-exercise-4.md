A video of our Duckiebot safely driving around the town behind another Duckiebot (controlled with keyboard controls). Observe our Duckiebot taking a right hand turn and left hand turn at the intersections and driving at least two full laps of the town.

## Strategy

TODO: A brief paragraph describing your implemented strategy for maintaining a safe driving
distance and avoided collisions

## Discussion

TODO: A brief paragraph discussing your results; please answer these questions:


### How well did your implemented strategy work?

TODO

### Was it reliable?

Overall our strategy was fairly reliable, as it is able to drive around the
town without crashing into other Duckiebots, tail another Duckiebot
autonomously at a safe distance. Furthermore, it also follows the rules of the
road by driving within the lanes, stopping at intersections, and blinking the
appropriate rear LED to signal turns.

### In what situations did it perform poorly?

Sometimes our code does not detect when the Duckiebot it is tracking makes a
turn as the Duckiebot detection package sometimes fails to detect the pattern
when the tracked Duckiebot turns too quickly.
