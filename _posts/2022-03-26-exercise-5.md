## MNIST Dataset and ML basic terminologies

### Deliverable 1

### Deliverable 2

### What data augmentation is used in training? Please delete the data augmentation and rerun the code to compare.

TODO

### What is the batch size in the code? Please change the batch size to 16 and 1024 and explain the variation in results.

TODO

### What activation function is used in the hidden layer? Please replace it with the linear activation function and see how the training output differs. Show your results before and after changing the activation function in your written report.

TODO

### What is the optimization algorithm in the code? Explain the role of optimization algorithm in training process

TODO

### Add dropout in the training and explain how the dropout layer helps in training

TODO

## Number Detection Node

### Deliverable 3

TODO: A brief paragraph describing your implemented strategy for number detection using ML

TODO: A brief paragraph discussing your results; please answer these questions:

### How well did your implemented strategy work?

TODO
