This webbed-site hosts written lab exercise reports by Steven Tang for
[CMPUT 412 Experimental
Mobile Robotics](https://apps.ualberta.ca/catalogue/archive/course/cmput/412/1820).
In our labs, we work with Duckiebots, a low-cost mobile robot from
[Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/) to implement various mobile robotics
concepts to perform specific tasks. Exercises 2 through 5 and the final project
were completed with Akemi Izuko, who has a corresponding website at
[noway.moe/duckietown](https://noway.moe/duckietown).
